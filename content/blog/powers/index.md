### Kinetic Energy Manipulation:
Gambit can imbue objects with kinetic energy, allowing them to explode on contact or at a predetermined time. 

### Weapon of Choice: Playing Cards:
He is famous for using playing cards as his primary weapon, though he can charge any object. 

### Other Abilities:
Besides his kinetic energy manipulation, Gambit is also a skilled thief, trained in stealth, lockpicking, and hand-to-hand combat. 
### Control:
While he may seem super in control of these powers, he actually constantly fears that he isn't and even made a deal with Mr sinister to help him have more control over them yet in the comics.
